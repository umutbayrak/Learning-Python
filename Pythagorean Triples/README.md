# Learning-Python---Pythagorean-Triples
An exercise from Python class

A Pythagorean triple (a,b,c) consists of three strictly positive integers a, b and c, for which a2+b2=c2. The name is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, stating that every right triangle has side lengths satisfying the formula a2+b2=c2. Thus, Pythagorean triples describe the three integer side lengths of a right triangle. However, right triangles with non-integer sides do not form Pythagorean triples.

A well-known example of a Pythagorean triple is (3,4,5), but also its multiples such as (6,8,10) and (9,12,15) are Pythagorean triples. In general, if (a,b,c) is a Pythagorean triple, then so is (ka,kb,kc) for any positive integer k. A primitive Pythagorean triple (a,b,c) is one in which a, b and c are coprime. As an example, there are four Pythagorean triples (a,b,c) for which a+b+c=240: (15,112,113), (40,96,104), (48,90,102) and (60,80,100).

Pythagorean triples have been known since ancient times.  Babylonian clay tablets dating from the time of Hammurabi already mention Pythagorean triples. The oldest known record comes from Plimpton 322, a Babylonian clay tablet from about 1800BC, written in a sexagesimal number system. It was discovered by Edgar James Banks shortly after 1900, and sold to George Arthur Plimpton in 1922 for $10. This clay tablet lists 15 triplets, including (56,90,106), (119,120,169) and even (12709,13500,18541). Pythagorean triples were also known in India. The earliest Baudhayana-Sulbasutra (dating back to the sixth century before Christ) contains five such triples.

Input

A number n∈N0.

Output

A list of all Pythagorean triples (a,b,c) for which 0<a≤b≤c and a+b+c=n. These triples must be written as (a, b, c), each on a separate line and sorted in increasing order according to a, then b and then c.
